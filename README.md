## Abstract
In this paper, we propose novel channel models for (i) stochastic Terahertz (THz) communications and (ii) reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided THz systems. Considering
a spherical network with stochastic relative distances between nodes, we derive an exact distribution for the direct link; using the method of moments, we prove that the cascaded channel can be precisely characterized by α-μ distribution. The obtained channel models are used to evaluate the system’s performance in terms of outage probability. We show that by using a massive number of reflecting elements, the cascaded link outperforms the direct THz link.
